# Off-Road Autonomy

## Introduction

Off-Road Autonomy drives a vehicle along unmarked dirt trails in BeamNG.tech using one dashcam. It segments the drivable trail with a YOLOE-26 model, plans a centreline and steers with configurable Stanley or MPC control.

Perception uses RGB segmentation only. There is no depth estimation, terrain fusion or depth-based obstacle veto. One GMSL2 dashcam with 120° horizontal FOV supplies segmentation, planning, control and the dashboard. It retains the previous dashcam mount: height 1.85 m, forward offset -0.30 m, pitch -8°. Capture is 960x620 at 30 FPS, processed at 720x465. The dashboard draws the same captured frame and its results; it does not poll another camera. Debug views are `0` path, `1` raw dashcam, `6` mask and `9` pipeline. Configure the sensor, mount and hood exclusion under `beamng.camera`. Ground distances still use a flat-ground assumption. Old `beamng.cameras`, `segmentation_mode` and `stitching` settings must be removed.

It runs on Windows, WSL2, macOS or a Jetson. BeamNG.tech itself runs only on Windows, so every other machine connects to it over the network.

When the hood hides the nearest part of the path, steering joins a visible lookahead point with a geometric pursuit arc. It does not extrapolate the path backward under the hood, which could reverse the commanded turn. Stanley tracking resumes when the predicted vehicle position lies within the observed path.

## Setup

Requires Python 3.10+ and BeamNG.tech 0.38 (`beamngpy` 1.35).

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Put the model weights in `models/`: `yoloe-26x-seg.pt` (default config), `yoloe-26s-seg.pt` (Jetson) and `mobileclip2_b.ts` (the YOLOE text encoder).

### Connect To BeamNG

BeamNG.tech runs only on Windows. The Windows machine running it is the BeamNG host. The stack runs either on the BeamNG host or on another machine that connects to it.

| Stack Runs On                | What To Set                                                  | How To Start BeamNG      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Windows, on the BeamNG host  | Nothing. Optional: `BEAMNG_HOME` lets the stack start BeamNG | Normally                 |
| WSL2, on the BeamNG host     | Nothing                                                      | Listening on the network |
| macOS                        | `BEAMNG_HOST` (the BeamNG host's address)                    | Listening on the network |
| Jetson                       | `BEAMNG_HOST` (the BeamNG host's address)                    | Listening on the network |

For WSL2, macOS and Jetson, BeamNG must listen on the network. Start it from PowerShell on the BeamNG host:

```powershell
cd "<your BeamNG.tech folder>"
.\Bin64\BeamNG.tech.x64.exe -nosteam -tcom -tport 64256 -tcom-listen-ip "*"
```

If the connection is refused, allow TCP port 64256 through the Windows firewall. For macOS and Jetson, find the BeamNG host's address with `ipconfig`.

The first log line shows the address the stack connects to. `BEAMNG_HOST` overrides it on any machine.

## Run

```bash
offroad-autonomy
```

For MPC with Stanley fallback, run `offroad-autonomy --config configs/mpc.yaml`.
Select `control.controller: stanley` or `mpc` in YAML. Stanley remains the default
baseline while MPC is evaluated.

For the bird's-eye grid planner, run `offroad-autonomy --config configs/grid.yaml`.
To pair it with MPC, run `offroad-autonomy --config configs/grid-mpc.yaml`.

### Grid Planner

`planning.mode: grid` projects the road mask onto flat ground, fuses it over time using the
vehicle's own motion, and picks the best of a fan of steerable arcs on that grid
(`planning/bev_grid.py`, `planning/arc_planner.py`). It was built for the roof-mounted dashcam,
whose hood hides the first ~3 m of ground and whose image edges cut wide trails:

- Ground the camera cannot see is unknown, never "not road", so a trail running off the side of
  the image does not pull the path toward the visible part.
- Memory carries the road the hood now hides, using the simulator's direction vector to follow
  the vehicle's motion. Without a valid pose the grid forgets rather than smearing.
- Frames the perception gate rejects move the grid with the vehicle but add no evidence.
- Arcs end where the vehicle's body would leave the road, and the path only extends as far as
  the grid has seen road, so the path-end speed law still applies.
- The projection assumes flat ground: on crests and in dips far cells are misplaced, and the
  grid has no height information, so obstacles the segmenter labels as road are not seen.

Settings, with reasons, are in `planning.grid` in `configs/default.yaml`. The baseline planner
stays the default until the grid planner has been compared on several maps.

The BeamNG client selects realistic shifting and forward drive on startup and
resume, so holding the brake cannot engage arcade reverse. Manual gearboxes use
first gear for low-speed off-road operation; automatics select Drive. Gate holds
show their reason in the dashboard and console. The default gate accepts a
connected road at confidence 0.18 or above and still rejects insufficient or
disconnected road masks. Run `python scripts/check_brake_hold.py --reproduce-arcade`
to reproduce the former reversal and verify the brake-hold/forward-restart fix.

- Starts BeamNG.tech when `BEAMNG_HOME` is set and it is not already running, then spawns the vehicle and opens the dashboard
- `E` safe stop, `P` resume, `0`, `1`, `6`, `9` debug views, `T` timing overlay, `Q` quit
- `--headless` runs without a window
- `--record-video` saves the dashboard to an mp4 (see Record The Dashboard below)
- `--presentation` saves a 1920 x 1080 video for an audience outside the team (see Record A Presentation below)

### Record The Dashboard

```bash
offroad-autonomy --record-video
offroad-autonomy --record-video --headless --benchmark-seconds 60 --label stanley-run
```

`--record-video` saves the dashboard, exactly as drawn, to `output/videos/<label>_<timestamp>.mp4`
(or the path given with `--record-video-out`). The file is H.264 in yuv420p with the index at the
front, so it plays in the VS Code media preview and in browsers.

- Needs `ffmpeg` with libx264 on `PATH` (`sudo apt install ffmpeg`). Without it the run stops before
  connecting to BeamNG. A snap-packaged ffmpeg cannot write under `/tmp`, so keep the output in
  your home directory.
- Encoding runs in a separate ffmpeg process fed from its own thread, so neither the control loop
  nor the dashboard waits for it. If the encoder falls behind, frames are dropped from the video
  and counted in the log when the run ends.
- Frames are paced onto a constant `recording.fps`, so the video plays back at real speed even
  when the dashboard stalls.
- With `--headless` the dashboard is drawn off screen for the recording only.
- Quality, preset and queue length are in the `recording` section of `configs/default.yaml`.

### Record A Presentation

```bash
offroad-autonomy --presentation
offroad-autonomy --presentation --headless --presentation-out ~/videos/demo.mp4
offroad-autonomy --presentation --record-video
```

`--presentation` records a 1920 x 1080 "Split Story" video to
`output/presentations/<label>_<timestamp>.mp4` (or the path given with `--presentation-out`), apart
from the dashboard recordings in `output/videos/`. It uses the same ffmpeg recorder and `recording`
settings as `--record-video`. Add `--record-video` to record the dashboard as well, to its own
file. The two paths must differ. The window, if there is one, still shows the operator dashboard,
unchanged.

- **Left:** a chase camera behind and above the vehicle, labelled Orbit Camera. Until its first
  frame arrives the view reads No Orbit Signal.
- **Top right:** the dashcam image with the traversable mask, planned path and ego exclusion, drawn
  by the same code as the dashboard's view.
- **Bottom right:** speed, steering, Autonomy FPS, latency mean / p95, Road / Valid Px and
  segmentation confidence, coloured by the dashboard's rules and thresholds.
- **Safe stop:** the header chip turns solid red, the orbit view gets a red wash and border, and no
  path is drawn on the dashcam image.

The orbit camera is attached only with this flag, and no pipeline stage reads it. Its pose,
resolution and field of view are in the `presentation` section of `configs/default.yaml`. The main
loop polls it right after each dashcam frame, because the socket transport cannot be read from the
dashboard thread. That poll is logged as the `orbit_capture` stage and is part of the measured
primary loop, so the Autonomy FPS in the video is the real rate of the loop with the camera
attached. It has not yet been measured against BeamNG, so expect a lower FPS than without the flag
until it has.

The presentation frame is drawn on a thread of its own, separate from the window's, so it never
adds to the loop period, even when the window has to be drawn inline. Its render time is in the
periodic runtime log line.

### Dashboard

The 1600 x 900 dashboard has a header with the autonomy status, the dashcam view with the traversable mask, planned path and ego exclusion, a Vehicle card, a Perception card and a Runtime strip. Speed is the largest number on screen.

- **Safe stop:** a red wash, a red border and a banner cover the dashcam view, and no planned path is drawn.
- **Autonomy FPS:** green at `visualization.dashboard.target_fps` or above, amber from `fps_warn_fraction` of it up to the target, red below that. Latency is red when its p95 passes `latency_budget_ms`.
- **Segmentation confidence:** red below the gate's `planning.gate.confidence_threshold`, amber up to `confidence_good`, green above.
- **Ticks:** the Road / Valid Px bar is marked at `safety.min_road_fraction` and the confidence bar at the gate threshold, both read from their own config sections.
- **Dashboard FPS:** shown in its own tile and never colored, because a slow window says nothing about the vehicle.
- **Held path:** when the planner holds a fallback path, it is drawn dashed in amber.

Text is drawn with Pillow using the bundled IBM Plex Sans and Mono fonts in `src/offroad_autonomy/visualization/fonts/` (SIL Open Font License, included). A missing font file stops startup.

## Run On Jetson (Docker)

Requires JetPack 6 with the NVIDIA container runtime. Start BeamNG listening on the network first (see [Connect To BeamNG](#connect-to-beamng)).

1. Build the image and export the TensorRT engine (first time only, since engines are tied to the device that builds them):

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose run --rm --entrypoint python autonomy scripts/export_engine.py --weights models/yoloe-26s-seg.pt
```

2. Run:

```bash
BEAMNG_HOST=192.168.1.50 docker compose up
```

- The container runs `configs/jetson.yaml`: TensorRT engine, headless
- `models/`, `output/` and `configs/` are mounted from the host, so config changes need no rebuild
- `docker compose stop` parks the vehicle before disconnecting

## Development Notes

- Package code is in `src/offroad_autonomy/`; the entry point is `main.py`, and the stage order is in `pipeline.py`
- Only `simulation/beamng_client.py` imports `beamngpy`
- `configs/default.yaml` holds every tuning value, with the reason for it next to the key; `configs/jetson.yaml` overrides it through `extends:`
- `beamng.host`, `beamng.launch`, `beamng.camera_transport` and `ui.display_async` default to `auto` and are derived from the platform; `BEAMNG_HOST`, `BEAMNG_PORT`, `BEAMNG_HOME` and `BEAMNG_LAUNCH` override the `beamng:` block
- The dashboard runs on its own thread, and the control loop never waits for it
- After changing the mount or lens in `beamng.camera`, re-run `scripts/derive_ego_mask.py` and re-check `planning.roi_height`
- Manual driving (W/A/S/D under safe stop) reads the OS key state and works only on Windows
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint, format, the S-bend check, tests with coverage and the build on Python 3.10; CodeQL scans weekly and on every pull request; Dependabot watches pip, the Docker base image and the Actions

## Contribution Rules

- Create a new branch from main for every change.
- Do not commit directly to main.
- Open a pull request into main when the change is ready.
- Keep pull requests small, focused, and easy to review.
- Run `ruff check src tests scripts`, `ruff format --check src tests scripts` and `pytest --cov` before opening a pull request.
- Run `python scripts/sbend_sim.py` after changing the controller or its config.
- No ternary expressions, and no single-line `if` bodies.
- Comments explain why, not what.
- Do not create commits unless explicitly asked.
- Before finishing, summarize what changed, what commands were run, what commands could not be run, and any remaining risks.
